"""Create the pipeline's Kafka topics on the local Redpanda broker.

Topics are named through the shared contract module (TOPIC_PLAY_EVENTS /
TOPIC_TRACK_ACTIVITY), never string literals, so the names cannot drift from
the contract the producer and both consumers import.

Both topics are created with 3 partitions -- not 1 -- so the Phase 6 demo can
visibly show different keys landing on different partitions, which is the whole
point of the two-key pipeline.

Both topics also turn write caching off. The Redpanda image starts in developer
mode, where an acks=all write is acknowledged from memory before it reaches
disk, so a broker crash loses events the producer was told were safe. The crash
tests in bench/BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md measured that loss, and its absence once
this setting and producer idempotence are both on.

Usage:
    # make sure the broker is up first:  docker compose up -d
    python src/create_topics.py
    python src/create_topics.py --broker localhost:9092

"""The two cohort queries, and the deterministic cohort report.

TWO QUERIES, BECAUSE THE TWO TOPOLOGIES HAVE OPPOSITE SHAPES AND ONE QUERY
CANNOT FIND BOTH. This is the whole argument for the graph layer, so it is
stated here rather than left implicit in two function names.

  - CO-LISTENING OVERLAP finds a DENSE BIPARTITE BLOCK: a set of accounts that
    touched a near-identical set of tracks. This is the FRAUDAR / CopyCatch
    dense-subgraph pattern the research describes, and it is not expressible as
    a keyed aggregation -- density is a property of the relationships, not of
    any one key, so neither Consumer 1 (keyed by listener) nor Consumer 2 (keyed
    by track) can see it at all.
  - FAN-IN WITH NO OTHER ACTIVITY finds a MAXIMAL FAN-IN STAR, whose signature
    is the ABSENCE of any other activity rather than overlap. These listeners
    exist in the dataset for exactly one reason and their pairwise overlap with
    each other is near zero, so the first query cannot find them.

Writing only the first would miss the case the review queue actually flagged;
writing only the second would miss the more interesting structure.

FOUR THINGS THAT WILL RETURN A PLAUSIBLE WRONG ANSWER IF GOT WRONG.

1. `UNIQUE` ON BOTH SIDES, ALWAYS. The graph holds 45,473 edges over 13,985
   distinct (listener, track) pairs -- a mean of 3.25 plays per pair, maximum 14.
   A query that groups peers and takes `COUNT` counts EDGES, so every overlap
   comes back roughly threefold. A true 438 reads as about 1,400, which is a
   number a reviewer would accept. Every count in this module is the size of a
   UNIQUE set, and `tests/test_graph_queries.py` rejects a built query that
   would count edges rather than relying on anyone noticing.

2. THE SEEDS ARE READ FROM THE SHIPPED ARTIFACTS, NEVER TYPED. The flagged
   listener comes from `output/listener_review_queue.json` and the flagged track
   from `output/track_review_queue.json`, so the graph layer and the keyed
   pipeline cannot disagree about which listener and which track were flagged.
   No identifier appears as a literal in this module, and a test enforces that
   with an AST scan.

3. THE FAN-IN QUERY RETURNS 928, NOT 901, AND 928 IS CORRECT. The review queue's
   901 is measured inside ONE event-time hour, because Consumer 2's rule is a
   one-hour bucket. This graph is unwindowed and covers the whole stream, so it
   sees every listener who ever touched the track: 900 from the fan-in cohort,
   plus normal listeners, plus flagged ones. Both numbers are right and they
   measure different things. The report says so in as many words, because a
   reader who sees only one of them will try to reconcile it and conclude
   something is broken. Do not "fix" this query until it returns 901.

4. A COHORT WITH NO BASELINE IS A THRESHOLD CHOICE, NOT A FINDING. The report
   carries the measured normal pairwise overlap next to the cohort's, so the
   separation is visible as a property of the data. The baseline pool
   deliberately EXCLUDES single-track listeners: pairwise overlap among accounts
   that played one track each is trivially near zero, and including them would
   drive the baseline down and make the separation look larger than it is. The
   conservative choice is the honest one here.

THE REPORT REACHES NO VERDICT, AND THAT BOUND IS INHERITED RATHER THAN RESTATED.
`VERDICT_LEXICON` is imported from `src/summarize_review_queue.py`, so this layer
carries the same bound the review queue and the LLM summary already carry and the
three cannot drift. This is the most dangerous artifact this project produces --
it names hundreds of accounts at once, on evidence a reviewer will not
independently recompute -- and a false positive withholds money from an innocent
artist.

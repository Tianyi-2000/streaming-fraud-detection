"""The two cohort queries: construction without a database, results with one.

WHAT THIS FILE IS GUARDING, because both failures return plausible numbers.

FIRST, `UNIQUE` ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CO-LISTENING QUERY. The graph holds 45,473
edges over 13,985 distinct (listener, track) pairs -- a mean of 3.25 plays per
pair. A query that groups peers and takes `COUNT` is counting EDGES, so every
overlap comes back roughly threefold: a real 438 reads as ~1,400, which looks
like a perfectly reasonable answer and is wrong. The construction test asserts
`UNIQUE` is present rather than trusting a reviewer to notice its absence, and
the live thresholds are calibrated on measured DISTINCT-track overlaps so an
inflated count fails rather than passes.

SECOND, THE SEEDS ARE READ, NEVER TYPED. Both come from the shipped review-queue
artifacts, so the graph layer and the keyed pipeline cannot disagree about which
listener and which track were flagged. The tests prove this by pointing the
readers at temporary queues naming DIFFERENT ids and asserting the seeds follow.

THIRD, 928 IS NOT A CONTRADICTION OF 901 AND MUST NOT BE "FIXED" INTO ONE. The
review queue's 901 is one event-time hour, because Consumer 2's rule is a
one-hour bucket. The graph is unwindowed and covers the whole stream, so it sees
928 distinct inbound listeners: 900 Topology B, 20 normal, 8 Topology A. The test
asserts CONTAINMENT -- every one of the 900 single-play listeners is inbound to
the flagged track -- rather than equality of two totals that measure different
things. Asserting equality would force someone to break a correct query.

FOURTH, NO VERDICT LANGUAGE. `VERDICT_LEXICON` is IMPORTED from
`src/summarize_review_queue.py`, never restated, so this layer inherits the bound
the review queue and the summary already carry. The report names 900 accounts at
once; it is the most dangerous artifact this project produces.

Live-graph tests SKIP with a named regeneration command when the database is
absent, the pattern this project already uses for full-scale artifacts.
